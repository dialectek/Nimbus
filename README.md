# Nimbus
Close range information sharing for local  cooperation.

Once upon a time, people interacted in high fidelity face-to-face. That multi-channeled pipe 
carrying pheromones to phonemes has become a trickle of bits. Those days are gone and are 
probably not coming back soon. No one is going to give up their devices and connection to 
the ether. But we can ameliorate by changing the bandwidth between people, expanding or 
filtering the pipe. Nimbus aims to address this. Users exude a "nimbus" of information that 
is visible in their geographical surroundings. A multiplicity of data may be revealed, enabling 
a plethora of possible cooperative activities. For example, a group of people convening at a 
social event could become familiarized with each other by perusing each other's profiles. 
Alternatively, a business could scan in-store patron profiles to make customized offers. 
Participant information could be authenticated by trusted parties to foster trust. Without 
knowledge of individuals, people often stereotype based on generalizations, sometimes to 
tragic outcomes. Sharing authentic information published by individuals can help avoid stereotyping.

Some use cases:
1. A customer enters a store. The storekeeper is informed what the customer is looking for and 
   if the customer is trustworthy (no criminal record, etc.).
2. A man attends a social gathering and informs women in the vicinity of some personal information, 
   including being a safe person to talk to and/or leave with.
3. A police car passes a car and the driver's nimbus vouches for their good driving record.
4. Shy people let their AIs commune a bit before proceeding on a more personal basis.
