# Nimbus
Autenticated close range information sharing.

Once upon a time, people interacted in high fidelity face-to-face. That multi-layered 
pipe carrying pheromones to phonemes has become a trickle of bits. Those days are gone 
and are not coming back. No one is going to give up their devices and connection to the 
ether. But we can remediate by changing the bandwidth between people, expanding or filtering 
the pipe. Nimbus aims to address this. Users exude a nimbus of information that is visible 
in their surroundings. A multiplicity of data may be revealed, some of which can be 
authenticated by trusted parties. Every day, people encounter strangers that are evaluated 
based on generalizations. A bane of generalization is that it at times causes unfair stereotyping. 
Nimbus can help.

Some usages:
1. A customer enters a store. The storekeeper is informed what the customer is looking for and 
   if the customer is trustworthy (no criminal record, etc.).
2. A man attends a social gathering and informs women in the vicinity of some personal information, 
   including being a safe person to talk to and/or leave with.
3. A police car passes a car and the driver's nimbus vouches for their good driving record.
4. Shy people let their AIs commune a bit before proceeding on a more personal basis.
